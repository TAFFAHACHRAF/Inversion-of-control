#JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) architecture is a software architecture that provides tools and standards for the development and deployment of Java enterprise applications. JEE includes a range of specifications for the design, development, and deployment of applications, such as APIs for transaction management, web services, messaging services, servlets, JSP, etc.

Middlewares are software that facilitates communication and data management between the different layers of an application. They provide services such as transaction management, data persistence, security, caching, load balancing, messaging, etc. Middlewares are often used in distributed applications to ensure data consistency and reliability.

In a JEE architecture, middlewares are often used to provide additional services to the application. For example, a JEE application server can use a messaging middleware to send and receive messages between different components of the application. Other common middlewares used in JEE architectures include caching middlewares, security middlewares, and data persistence middlewares.
